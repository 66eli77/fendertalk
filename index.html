<h2 class="margin"><span class="title_style">Further Information for Users</span></h2>
<br>
<p class="margin"><span class="text_bold_style">Legal basis of processing</span> </p>
<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</span> </p>


<ul class="ol_style" type="disc">
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</span> </p>

<br>
<p class="margin"><span class="text_bold_style">Further information about retention time</span> </p>
<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.</span> </p>

<br>
<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Therefore:</span> </p>
<ul class="ol_style" type="disc">
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_bold_style">The rights of Users based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span> </p>
<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">In particular, Users have the right to do the following, to the extent permitted by law:</span> </p>
<ul class="ol_style" type="disc">
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Withdraw their consent at any time. Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Object to processing of their Data. Users have the right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Access their Data. Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed. Users have the right to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller. Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.</span></li>
    <li class="li_style"><span class="li_text">Lodge a complaint. Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis for Data transfers abroad including to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.</span> </p>

<br>
<p class="margin"><span class="text_bold_style">Details about the right to object to processing</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_bold_style">How to exercise these rights</span> </p>

<br>

<p class="margin"><span class="text_style">Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in this document. Such requests are free of charge and will be answered by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month, providing Users with the information required by law. Any rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing will be communicated by the Owner to each recipient, if any, to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. At the Users’ request, the Owner will inform them about those recipients.</span> </p>
